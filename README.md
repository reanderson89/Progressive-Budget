  ## **Description**
  This app allows users to keep track of their budget. The user can add funds or subtract funds depending on money coming in and going out. Users also have the option to install this application to their desktop or device. This application also allows users to track their budget even if they are offline. It will store their transactions using indexedDB and then will process them through to the database once they establish internet connection again.
